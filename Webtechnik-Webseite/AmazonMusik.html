    <h1>History</h1>
        <h3>Amazon Music (previously Amazon MP3) is a music streaming platform and online music store operated by Amazon.com. </h3>
        <h3>Launched in public beta on September 25, 2007, in January 2008 it became the first music store to sell music without digital rights management (DRM) from the four major music labels (EMI, Universal, Warner Music, and Sony BMG), as well as many independents. </h3>
        <h3>All tracks were originally sold in 256 kilobits-per-second variable bitrate MP3 format without per-customer watermarking or DRM; however, some tracks are now watermarked. </h3>
        <h3>Licensing agreements with recording companies restrict which countries music can be sold.</h3>
